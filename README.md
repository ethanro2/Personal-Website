# Personal-Website
This repository is for the files used to create my personal website. This project was done to not only create a personal website to supplement my resume, but to help me learn the basics of html and css prior to taking a Web Development class. As of right now, the webpage is simple, but professional. I've been experiencing some issues with how it displays on mobile devices, however have decided to proceed with publicizing it while I still work out those issues.
